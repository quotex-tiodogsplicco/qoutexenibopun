## Is Quotex a Scam?

Yes, we believe that Quotex is a scam and you should not open an account
with them.

Their trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed
to make traders lose money in the long run. Quotex is not regulated by
any financial authorities so it is not a safe and legit broker and
nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady, unfair business
practices.

## Quotex FAQ

### Can Quotex make you rich?

No, it\'s very unlikely that Quotex will make you rich, so we don\'t
advise you to treat it as a passive income source. While it is possible
to make money on Quotex in the short term, but due to the nature of
binary options trading and the unfair conditions the broker offers, most
traders lose their deposited money over time.

options, however, many people consider it "fake" because it uses
scammy business practices that tries to make traders lose money on their
platform.

### Is Quotex halal or haram?

Quotex is generally considered haram, for the following reasons:

1.  Quotex only offers binary options trading which is often viewed as a
    form of gambling (\_maysir\_) that is clearly \_haram\_ (forbidden)
    in Islam.
2.  Quotex does not offer an Islamic accounts that comply with Sharia
    principles by eliminating elements like interest (riba) and
    excessive uncertainty (gharar).

### Is Quotex gambling?

Whether Quotex is gambling or not depends mainly on your trading
experience level.

For most Quotex users, trading on the platform is very similar to
gambling as they bet on short-term price movements with limited
financial knowledge, and they either receive a high fixed payout or lose
their entire bet, just like in a casino.

However, asset price movements are not random, and experienced traders
can predict them to some extent, so for them, Quotex is similar to
trading with other financial derivatives.
